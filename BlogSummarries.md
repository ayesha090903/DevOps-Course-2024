**Summary:**  
Build automation is a critical part of DevOps, focusing on automating tasks like code compilation, testing, and packaging. This improves efficiency, consistency, and scalability while enabling Continuous Integration (CI). Git plays a vital role by offering robust version control, enabling build triggers, managing branches, and facilitating collaboration. Implementing Git-based build automation with CI/CD tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI involves connecting repositories, defining pipelines, setting build triggers, and monitoring processes. Embracing Git-based build automation aligns with DevOps principles of collaboration, continuous improvement, and rapid, reliable delivery.

## 2. Mastering Kubernetes with K3s: An Open-Source and Lightweight Kubernetes Solution for Edge and IoT
[Mastering Kubernetes with K3s: An Open Source and Lightweight Kubernetes Solution for Edge and IoT](https://medium.com/@ayeshafaisal979/mastering-kubernetes-with-k3s-an-open-source-and-lightweight-kubernetes-solution-for-edge-and-iot-423b8166599a)


**Summary:**  
K3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed for resource-constrained environments like edge computing and IoT. Its features include a small footprint, simple installation, and support for ARM architectures, making it ideal for low-power devices. K3s is perfect for edge computing, IoT, development, and testing scenarios. Installation involves running a single command, and clusters can be managed with familiar Kubernetes tools like `kubectl`. With minimal resource requirements and fast setup, K3s enables Kubernetes deployments in environments unsuitable for full-scale Kubernetes setups.
